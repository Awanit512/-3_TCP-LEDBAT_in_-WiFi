# -3_TCP-LEDBAT_in_-WiFi
Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is Less than Best Effort (LBE) type of transport. BitTorrent and Apple Inc use variants of LEDBAT as their default transport mechanisms for large-sized file transfers. This project aims to evaluate the performance of LEDBAT in WiFi environments, including Gigabit WiFi, with and without Rate Adaptation.
