#3: **Exhaustive evaluation of TCP LEDBAT in WiFi environments.**

Brief: Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is Less than Best Effort (LBE) type of
transport. BitTorrent and Apple Inc use variants of LEDBAT as their default transport
mechanisms for large-sized file transfers. This project aims to evaluate the performance of
LEDBAT in WiFi environments, including Gigabit WiFi, with and without Rate Adaptation.

**Required experience**: C and C++
**Bonus experience**: Fundamentals of TCP LEDBAT and ns-3
**Difficulty**: Moderate
