   Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is Less than Best Effort (LBE) type of
 transport. BitTorrent and Apple Inc use variants of LEDBAT as their default transport
 mechanisms for large-sized file transfers. This project aims to evaluate the performance of
 LEDBAT in WiFi environments, including Gigabit WiFi, with and without Rate Adaptation.
