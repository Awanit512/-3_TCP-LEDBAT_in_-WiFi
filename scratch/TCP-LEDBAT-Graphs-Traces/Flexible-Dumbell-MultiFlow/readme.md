The arguments feeded to the exampe while running it are following: 

    ./waf --run "scratch/wifi-tcp-ledbat-multirate --simulationTime=33 --leftSTAs=8 --rightSTAs=8 --pcapTracing=true"
  
  ***
  
Thus, we can say that 

  > Experiment is ran for  simulationTime = 33 seconds.
  
  > We have made pcap tracing to be true 

  > There are 8 nodes at both right and left side of flexible dumbell.
